## Code contributions

Generally please tell us your ideas in the community chats before you write any code.
A pull requests chances to get merged strongly correlates with the code quality.

### Submitting changes to the core app

Note that this project is proprietary and any pull requests are implicitly "code donations".
The core app is complex and changes have to be well thought out, since changes often have unwanted side effects on some platforms.

### Submitting changes to existing plugins

Note that each plugin has its particular license (see plugin metadata).
Please contact the maintainer (see plugin metadata) and discuss the changes you want to implement.

### Adding new plugins

New extensions are always welcome.
Please see the [extension guide](https://albertlauncher.github.io/extending/) to get started.
Think about a maintainership of your plugin. Unfortunately code rots.
